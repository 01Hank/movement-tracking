# Realtime Face Movement Tracing
90 Lines of code to convert your face movement into keyboard commands.

# Description
This is a basic face movement tracking which can convert face movement into keyboard commands like **UP - DOWN - LEFT  - RIGHT**. I used facial landmarks to detect face and get the nose out of that for better referencing. Then I set refence to get left righ movemet at cernter with some boundary. I converts those movemets into keyboard commads using keyboard library.
